		Thank you for showing interest in this app. We take the security of our users very seriously and this will always be our top priority. The app was created to add stylish widgets to your home screen, while also having an intuitive experience. Another priority of ours is to ensure that your data is kept securely, and only on your device. 
		This privacy policy sets out how the app uses and protects any information that you give to the app when you use it.
		<br/><br/>
		We take limited data that is necessary for your widgets to function. The information we take is the time, the battery percentage, and the photo you select for your widgets.
		We do not and will never share, upload, or have access to this information. It strictly stays on your device, and is only accessible to you. When it comes to images, the app only saves the image you pick, which will never be shared with anyone other than yourself.
		If you upgrade to the PRO feature, your data will still be secured. We will not have any access to your email, billing address, banking details, or address. Apple proccesses all of the in-app payments.
		This Privacy Policy is subject to change periodically. By using the app you accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
